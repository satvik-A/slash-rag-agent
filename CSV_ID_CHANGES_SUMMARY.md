# CSV ID Integration Summary

## Changes Made to main2.py

### 1. Updated get_top_chunks function (Line ~130)
**Changed**: The chunks dictionary now includes csv_id
```python
# Before:
chunks.append({
    "id": chunk_id,
    "title": title,
    "price": chunk_price,
    "location": chunk_location
})

# After:
chunks.append({
    "id": chunk_id,
    "csv_id": csv_id,
    "title": title,
    "price": chunk_price,
    "location": chunk_location
})
```

### 2. Updated display output in run_this function (Line ~530)
**Changed**: Experience display now shows both chunk_id and csv_id
```python
# Before:
print(f"- {chunk['title']} (Price: ${chunk['price']:.2f})")

# After:
print(f"- {chunk['title']} (Price: ${chunk['price']:.2f}) [Chunk ID: {chunk['id']}, CSV ID: {chunk['csv_id']}]")
```

### 3. Updated Azure OpenAI context formatting (Line ~260)
**Changed**: Context sent to AI now includes both IDs for better tracking
```python
# Before:
context_parts.append(f"Experience: {chunk['title']} (Price: ${chunk['price']:.2f})")

# After:
context_parts.append(f"Experience: {chunk['title']} (Price: ${chunk['price']:.2f}) [Chunk ID: {chunk['id']}, CSV ID: {chunk['csv_id']}]")
```

## What these changes accomplish:

1. **Data Extraction**: The csv_id is now extracted from the Qdrant payload (this was already in place)
2. **Data Storage**: The csv_id is now stored in the chunks list alongside other information
3. **User Display**: Users now see both chunk_id and csv_id for each experience recommendation
4. **AI Context**: The AI model also receives both IDs in its context for better reference

## Expected Output Format:
```
üîç Here are some relevant experience options based on your context:
- Adventure Trek in Delhi (Price: $25.00) [Chunk ID: chunk_001, CSV ID: exp_001]
- Food Tour in Bangalore (Price: $18.00) [Chunk ID: chunk_002, CSV ID: exp_002]
```

## Testing:
- Created test_csv_id_output.py to verify csv_id extraction
- Created test_chunk_display.py to verify output formatting
- Both chunk_id and csv_id are now available for tracking and reference
